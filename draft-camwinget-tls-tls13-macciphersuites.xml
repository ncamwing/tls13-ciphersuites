    <abstract>
      <t>Use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained environments do not require data encryption, though mutual authentication during tunnel establishment and message integrity is still required. This document describes how keyed hash algorithms can be negotiated as ciphersuites in TLS 1.3 [will need to reference that draft here].</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are several use cases in which communications privacy is not strictly needed, although authenticity of the communications is still very important.  For example, within the Industrial Automation space there could be TCP or UDP communications which command a robotic arm to move a certain distance at a certain speed.  Without authenticity guarantees an attacker could modify the packets to change the movement of the robotic arm, potentially causing physical damage.  However, a threat model would very likely show that there is little to no need for confidentiality of this communication, as the packets only contain simple I/O commands.</t>
      <t>Besides having a strong need for authenticity and a weak need for confidentiality, many of these systems also have serious latency requirements.  Furthermore, several IoT devices (industrial or otherwise) have limited processing capability.  However, these IoT systems still gain great benefit from leveraging TLS 1.3 for secure communications.  Given the limited processing power and reduced need for confidentiality it is necessary to allow for cipher suites that maintain authenticity without confidentiality.  Cipher suites such as these are described in this document as "NULL cipher suites".  This document defines a number of NULL cipher suites for use within TLS 1.3.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Cipher Suites">
      <t>This document defines two cipher suites for use in TLS 1.3.  Both of these cipher suites use ECDHE for key agreement, and use SHA-256 for the HMAC.  The difference between these two is that one is based on certificates and the other on PSKs.</t>
      <section title="Certificate Cipher Suites">
	      <t>The certificate based cipher suite defined by this document is: </t>
		  <t>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256 = {0xC0, 0x0??}</t>
		  <t>Note that this is a new cipher suite not present in TLS 1.2.  This cipher suite uses ECDHE for the key exchange and ECDSA for the certificate's digital signature.  SHA-256 HMACs are used for the packet authentication.  This cipher suite is identical to the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_ NULL_SHA cipher suite described in RFC 4492 and RFC 5246, with the exception that it uses SHA-256 for the HMAC rather than SHA-1. </t>
	  </section>
      <section title="PSK Cipher Suites">
	      <t>The certificate based cipher suite defined by this document is: </t>
		  <t>TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256  = {0xC0, 0x03A}</t>
		  <t>Note that this is an existing cipher suite, defined in RFC 5489.  The purpose of this document is to standardize its use within TLS 1.3.  This cipher suite uses ECDHE for the key exchange and PSKs for authentication.  SHA-256 HMACs are used for packet authentication.   </t>
	  </section>		
    </section>


    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>As mentioned, the PSK-based cipher suite is already in use, and therefore has an assigned value from IANA.</t>
	  <t>The certificate-based cipher suite has been assigned the following value from IANA:</t>
	  <t>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256 = {0xC0, 0x0??}</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations present in RFC 4492 apply to this document as well.  Furthermore, as the cipher suites described in this document do not provide any confidentiality, it is important that they only be used in the special cases where there are no confidentiality concerns, and the performance degradation due to applying confidentiality is too great for the system to bear.</t>
