                 TLS_MAC_HASH Ciphersuites for TLS 1.3
                draft-camwinget-tls-ts13-macciphersuites

Abstract

   Use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained
   environments do not require data encryption, though mutual
   authentication during tunnel establishment and message integrity is
   still required.  This document describes how keyed hash algorithms
   can be negotiated as ciphersuites in TLS 1.3 [will need to reference
   that draft here].

1.  Introduction

   There are several use cases in which communications privacy is not
   strictly needed, although authenticity of the communications is still
   very important.  For example, within the Industrial Automation space
   there could be TCP or UDP communications which command a robotic arm
   to move a certain distance at a certain speed.  Without authenticity
   guarantees an attacker could modify the packets to change the
   movement of the robotic arm, potentially causing physical damage.
   However, a threat model would very likely show that there is little
   to no need for confidentiality of this communication, as the packets
   only contain simple I/O commands.

   Besides having a strong need for authenticity and a weak need for
   confidentiality, many of these systems also have serious latency
   requirements.  Furthermore, several IoT devices (industrial or
   otherwise) have limited processing capability.  However, these IoT
   systems still gain great benefit from leveraging TLS 1.3 for secure
   communications.  Given the limited processing power and reduced need
   for confidentiality it is necessary to allow for cipher suites that
   maintain authenticity without confidentiality.  Cipher suites such as
   these are described in this document as "NULL cipher suites".  This
   document defines a number of NULL cipher suites for use within TLS
   1.3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Cipher Suites

   This document defines two cipher suites for use in TLS 1.3.  Both of
   these cipher suites use ECDHE for key agreement, and use SHA-256 for
   the HMAC.  The difference between these two is that one is based on
   certificates and the other on PSKs.

3.1.  Certificate Cipher Suites

   The certificate based cipher suite defined by this document is:

   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256 = {0xC0, 0x0??}

   Note that this is a new cipher suite not present in TLS 1.2.  This
   cipher suite uses ECDHE for the key exchange and ECDSA for the
   certificate's digital signature.  SHA-256 HMACs are used for the
   packet authentication.  This cipher suite is identical to the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_ NULL_SHA cipher suite described in RFC 4492 and
   RFC 5246, with the exception that it uses SHA-256 for the HMAC rather
   than SHA-1.

3.2.  PSK Cipher Suites

   The certificate based cipher suite defined by this document is:

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256 = {0xC0, 0x03A}

   Note that this is an existing cipher suite, defined in RFC 5489.  The
   purpose of this document is to standardize its use within TLS 1.3.
   This cipher suite uses ECDHE for the key exchange and PSKs for
   authentication.  SHA-256 HMACs are used for packet authentication.

4.  IANA Considerations

   As mentioned, the PSK-based cipher suite is already in use, and
   therefore has an assigned value from IANA.

   The certificate-based cipher suite has been assigned the following
   value from IANA:

   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256 = {0xC0, 0x0??}

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations present in RFC 4492 apply to this
   document as well.  Furthermore, as the cipher suites described in
   this document do not provide any confidentiality, it is important
   that they only be used in the special cases where there are no

   confidentiality concerns, and the performance degradation due to
   applying confidentiality is too great for the system to bear.

   Communications Standards Groups (such as ODVA) as the motivation for
